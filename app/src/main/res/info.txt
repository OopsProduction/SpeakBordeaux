The Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 resulted from the 1855 Exposition Universelle de Paris, when Emperor Napoleon III requested a classification system for France's best Bordeaux wines which were to be on display for visitors from around the world.\n\nBrokers from the wine industry ranked the wines according to a château's reputation and trading price, which at that time was directly related to quality.
